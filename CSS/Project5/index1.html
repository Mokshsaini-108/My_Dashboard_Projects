              Furniture refers to objects intended to support various human
              activities such as seating (e.g., stools, chairs, and sofas),
              eating (tables), storing items, working, and sleeping (e.g., beds
              and hammocks). Furniture is also used to hold objects at a
              convenient height for work (as horizontal surfaces above the
              ground, such as tables and desks), or to store things (e.g.,
              cupboards, shelves, and drawers).

              A table is an item of furniture with a raised flat top and is
              supported most commonly by 1 to 4 legs (although some can have
              more). It is used as a surface for working at, eating from or on
              which to place things.[1][2] Some common types of tables are the
              dining room tables, which are used for seated persons to eat
              meals; the coffee table, which is a low table used in living rooms
              to display items or serve
